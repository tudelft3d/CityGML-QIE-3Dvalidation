I analysed the results quickly, some comments:

- you’re not using the QIE codes: when do you think you’ll implement these?
- it seems your implementation still doesn’t support inner rings. That
means that a lot of the errors you returned are wrong, there’s just a
“cascading effect” that caused the solid to be returned wrong but what
you return is no what should be returned. If you used (or mapped) the
error codes to the QIE ones that would help analyse. But if you
implement inner rings it’ll fix most problems (it ain’t an easy task
though).
- planarity: would be nice to know what tolerance you used, and can
that be adjusted?
- big-big coordinates = you have problems. But the solution is simple:
translate all input solids by their minx-ming and the problem is
solved.
