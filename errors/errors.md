# RING

| 101 -- TOO_FEW_POINTS |
|:--- |
| A ring should have at least 3 points. For GML rings, this error ignores the fact that the first and the last point of a ring are the same (see 103), ie a GML ring should have at least 4 points. |

| 102 -- CONSECUTIVE_POINTS_SAME |
|:--- |
| Points in a ring should not be repeated (except first-last in case of GML, see 103). This error is for the common error where 2 *consecutive* points are at the same location. Error 104 is for points in a ring that are repeated, but not consecutive. |

This ring is for instance invalid:

```xml
<gml:LinearRing>
  <gml:pos>0.0 0.0 0.0</gml:pos>
  <gml:pos>1.0 0.0 0.0</gml:pos>
  <gml:pos>1.0 0.0 0.0</gml:pos>
  <gml:pos>1.0 1.0 0.0</gml:pos>
  <gml:pos>0.0 1.0 0.0</gml:pos>
  <gml:pos>0.0 0.0 0.0</gml:pos>
</gml:LinearRing>
```

| 103 -- NOT_CLOSED |
|:--- |
| *This applies only to GML rings*. The first and last points have to be identical (at the same location). |

This ring is for instance invalid:

```xml
<gml:LinearRing>
  <gml:pos>0.0 0.0 0.0</gml:pos>
  <gml:pos>1.0 0.0 0.0</gml:pos>
  <gml:pos>1.0 1.0 0.0</gml:pos>
  <gml:pos>0.0 1.0 0.0</gml:pos>
</gml:LinearRing>
```

| 104 -- SELF_INTERSECTION |
|:--- |
| A ring should be *simple*, ie it should not self-intersect. The self-intersection can be at the location of an explicit point, or not. |

| 105 -- COLLAPSED_TO_LINE |
|:--- |
| A special case for self-intersection: the ring is collapsed to a line.  |

# POLYGON

| 201: INTERSECTION_RINGS |
|:--- |
| Two or more rings intersect, these can be either the exterior ring with an interior ring or only interior rings.       |

![](figs/201.png)

| 202: DUPLICATED_RINGS |
|:--- |
| Two or more rings are identical.  |


| 203: NON_PLANAR_POLYGON_DISTANCE_PLANE |
|:--- |
| A polygon must be planar, ie all its points (used for both the exterior and interior rings) must lie on a plane. To verify this, we must ensure that the the distance between every point and a plane is less than $$\epsilon_1$$, a given *tolerance* (eg 1cm). This plane should be a plane fitted with least-square adjustment. |

| 204: NON_PLANAR_POLYGON_NORMALS_DEVIATION |
|:--- |
| To ensure that cases such as that below are detected (the top polygon is clearly non-planar, but would not be detected with 203 and a tolerance of 1cm for instance) , another requirement is necessary: the distance between every point forming a polygon and *all* the planes defined by all possible combinaisons of 3 non-colinear points is less than $$\epsilon_1$$. In practice it can be implemented with a triangulation of the polygon (any triangulation): the orientation of the normal of each triangle must not deviate more than than a certain usef-defined tolerance $$\epsilon_2$$ (eg 1 degree).     |

![](figs/204.png)

| 205: INTERIOR_DISCONNECTED |
|:--- |
| The interior of a polygon must be connected. The combinaison of different valid rings can create such an error, see one example: |

![](figs/205.png)

| 206: HOLE_OUTSIDE |
|:--- |
| One or more interior ring(s) is(are) located completely outside the exterior ring. If the interior ring intersects the exterior ring, then error 201 should be returned. |

![](figs/206.png)

| 207: INNER_RINGS_NESTED |
|:--- |
| One or more interior ring(s) is(are) located completely inside another interior ring. |

![](figs/207.png)

| 208: ORIENTATION_RINGS_SAME |
|:--- |
| The interior rings must have the opposite direction (clockwise vs counterclockwise) when viewed from a given point-of-view. When the polygon is used as a bounding surface of a shell, then the rings have to have a specified orientation (see 307/308). |

# SHELL

| 301 -- TOO_FEW_POLYGONS |
|:--- |
| A shell should have at least 4 polygons---the simplest volumetric shape in 3D is a tetrahedron.  |


| 302 -- NOT_CLOSED |
|:--- |
| The shell must not have 'holes', ie it must be 'watertight'. This refers only to the topology of the shell, not to its geometry (see error 306) |


| 303 -- NON_MANIFOLD_VERTEX |
|:--- |
| Each shell must be simple, ie it must be a 2-manifold. A vertex is non-manifold when its incident polygons do not form one `umbrella'|

| 304 -- NON_MANIFOLD_EDGE |
|:--- |
| Each edge of a shell should have exactly 2 incident polygons. |

| 305 -- MULTIPLE_CONNECTED_COMPONENTS |
|:--- |
| Polygons that are not connected to the shell should be reported as an error. |

| 306 -- SELF_INTERSECTION |
|:--- |
| If topology of the shell is correct and it is closed (thus no error 302/303/304/305), it is possible that the geometry introduces errors, eg intersections. |

| 307 -- POLYGON_WRONG_ORIENTATION |
|:--- |
| If one polygon is used to construct a shell, its exterior ring must be oriented in such as way that when viewed from outside the shell the points are ordered counterclockwise. |

| 308 -- ALL_POLYGONS_WRONG_ORIENTATION |
|:--- |
| If all the polygons have the wrong orientation (as defined in 307). |
